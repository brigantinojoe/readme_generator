# README Generator

## Description
There are easy ways to complete repetitive tasks and there are hard ways. The easiest way is now by running a simple javascript file from your command line, and enjoy the product! Creating this project required installing the inquirer package of node.js to run prompts on the command line. It's really amazing what you can do with a few lines of javascript in node.js.
